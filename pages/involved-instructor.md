Data Carpentry workshops are taught by trained, peer, volunteer instructors. We
work with the [Software Carpentry Foundation](http://software-carpentry.org) to develop and deliver a
Train the Trainers (T3) program. This program teaches instructional pedagogy as 
well as the practicalities of teaching a Software or Data Carpentry workshop. 


### Data Carpentry 'Fast Track' Instructors Application

There are currently
many Software Carpentry instructors interested in being Data Carpentry instructors
and trained educators interested in teaching workshops. To enable this 
transition, we have instituted a 'Fast Track' program. 

If you are interested in teaching people new to computation and data analysis, 
have the skills to teach
introductory R, Python or SQL and demonstrated teaching experience as a Software
Carpentry instructor or in another capacity, please fill out our

[Application to be a Data Carpentry Instructor]( )

We are interested in instructors in any domain of research, and are particularly 
working to grow our instructor pool in social sciences and digital humanities. 

There are many opportunities to teach at workshops around the world, and we
would love to have you as an instructor! 


### Information on Train the Trainer events with the Software Carpentry Foundation

We will be working with Software Carpentry to provide both Software and Data
Carpentry train-the-trainer instruction in future T3s.

as it becomes available.
