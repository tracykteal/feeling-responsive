title: Data Carpentry Workshop Fees

After discussion with our Steering Committee and the Software Carpentry Foundation, 
we have decided to increase our workshop coordination fee in order to better 
reflect the real cost of our staff’s time, our overheads and the value of the 
training. This is part of our broader efforts to make sure that Data Carpentry 
provides the best training possible and is sustainable long into the future.

Like [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/), if a workshop is requested after September 1, 2015, the 
fee will be $2500 per workshop for universities and non-profits. We will continue 
to respond to requests for waivers from organizations that would otherwise not 
be able to afford a workshop.

We are also in the process of developing an affiliate/partner program so that in the 
future it will be possible to reduce the cost of individual workshops by partnering 
with us directly*.

If you are interested in hosting a workshop, please fill out the form at 
[http://datacarpentry.org/workshop-request.html](http://datacarpentry.org/workshop-request.html) 
and don’t hesitate to get in touch at [info@datacarpentry.org](mailto:info@datacarpentry.org) if you have any questions. 

* Note that SCF discounts do not apply to Data Carpentry workshops
