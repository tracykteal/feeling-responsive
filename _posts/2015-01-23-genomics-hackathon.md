Through the support of [SESYNC](https://www.sesync.org), [BEACON](http://beacon-center.org) and
[iPlant](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org) we are
holding a hackathon for the development of lessons for a Genomics Data Carpentry and to develop
assessment for these lessons as well as an assessment framework for all Data Carpentry lessons.

Dates: March 23-25, 2015  
Location: Cold Spring Harbor Labs, NY

**Goal**: Develop materials and assessment for a two day Data Carpentry workshop focusing on the skills needed to work with genomic data

[Call for Participation](http://goo.gl/iLvaP0)

[Application for Participation](http://goo.gl/dqmkwI)  deadline: January 30, 2015


We would love to have the participation of people working in genomics or bioinformatics, those involved in
training in this domain, those working in assessment, or any others who are interested in helping to shape the curriculum.
We aim to assemble a diverse and interdisciplinary group of scientists, educators, and developers, encompassing various
levels of experience and a broad set of skills and encourage applications from anyone interested.

We're very excited about this event and the opportunity to develop lessons targeting genomics researchers and build
assessment in to the curriculum. Travel support is available. Please apply to participate!

If you are wondering if you should apply to participate in this hackathon or have any questions, please get in touch
